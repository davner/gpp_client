    "# GPP Client Design Overview\n",
    "\n",

This design abstracts common tasks such as fetching schema information, querying specific types, and mutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "These requirements were taken from the [science requirements for GOATS for GPP](https://noirlab.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GOATS/pages/17592221706/GOATS+GPP+science+requirements+for+GPP+support+of+GOATS)."

    "### [Marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/)\n",
    "Marshmallow is a powerful library for object serialization and deserialization in Python. It simplifies data validation and transformation, making it easy to handle complex data structures. For this proof of concept, Marshmallow is extended to support custom fields like Astropy's `Angle`, enabling seamless integration with astronomical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [gql](https://gql.readthedocs.io/)\n",
    "The `gql` library provides a Pythonic way to interact with GraphQL APIs. It supports synchronous and asynchronous operations, query building with a domain-specific language (DSL), and schema introspection. This library is central to dynamically building and validating GraphQL queries in this proof of concept."

    "# Wishlist for the `gpp_client` Library\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simplified Query and Mutation Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "To streamline usage, I would like the `gpp_client` library to include prebuilt, commonly used functions that abstract the complexity of building GraphQL queries or mutations. These functions would eliminate the need for users to construct DSL queries manually, providing an intuitive interface for interacting with the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features I'd Like to See\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Field Selection**\n",
    "   - Ability to request all fields for a query by default.\n",
    "   - Option to pass in a specific list of fields, allowing the query to be modified dynamically to include only the requested fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Prebuilt Functions**\n",
    "   - Functions like `get_observation_by_id` that encapsulate common operations (e.g., fetching an observation by ID).\n",
    "   - Support for similar mutations and other queries with minimal input required from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data as Classes**\n",
    "   - Instead of returning raw dictionaries, the library should deserialize data into Python classes.\n",
    "   - This would provide attribute-based access to data, making it easier and more intuitive to use, especially for larger or nested structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ease of Use**\n",
    "   - Reduce the cognitive load by offering clear, reusable, and well-documented functions.\n",
    "   - Maintain flexibility for power users while catering to simpler use cases for quick API interactions."

    "## Extending Marshmallow Fields with Custom Astropy Angle Serialization\n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation, I extended the functionality of `Marshmallow`, a powerful library for object serialization and deserialization, to include support for a custom Astropy `Angle` field. This allows seamless conversion of Astropy `Angle` objects to and from serialized representations, such as JSON. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Marshmallow?\n",
    "\n",
    "Marshmallow is a robust and flexible serialization library that provides:\n",
    "- **Customizability**: The ability to define custom fields tailored to specific data types or libraries.\n",
    "- **Integration**: Easy integration with various Python libraries, including `Astropy`.\n",
    "- **Validation**: Built-in validation for serialized data.\n",
    "- **Adoption**: Widely used in the Python community, including by the `ANTARES` team, who rely on it for their client.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case: Serializing Astropy Angles\n",
    "\n",
    "Astropyâ€™s `Angle` class is commonly used in astronomical calculations to represent angular measurements in various units. For example, converting an angle from arcseconds to microarcseconds can be tedious and error-prone if done manually. By creating a custom Marshmallow field, `AstropyAngleField`, we automate this process while ensuring precision and consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of `AstropyAngleField`\n",
    "- **Unit Conversion**: Automatically converts angles to the specified unit during serialization.\n",
    "- **Seamless Deserialization**: Reconstructs the original Astropy `Angle` object from its serialized form.\n",
    "- **Integration with Marshmallow Schemas**: Easily integrates into Marshmallow schemas, allowing complex objects to include Astropy angles as fields."

    "\n",
    "We need to be able to query a wide range of information about an observation and sequence. This is one of the key strengths of GraphQL, as it allows users to fetch only the data they need while omitting unnecessary information. By supporting a flexible mechanism to pass a list of fields into queries, we can optimize bandwidth usage and reduce the volume of extraneous data.\n",

    "### Desired Features\n",
    "- **Field Customization**: Allow users to specify exactly which fields they want to query, tailored to their needs.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Query Building**: Automatically construct queries based on the list of fields provided."
